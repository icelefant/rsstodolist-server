You better install django and the database driver using pip :

`pip install Django==1.5.5`

Then create a database and a dedicated user, for mysql :

`mysql -u rsstodolist -p`
`create database rsstodolist;`
`grant all privileges on rsstodolist.* to 'rsstodolist'@'localhost' identified by 'CHANGEME';`

Then, youâ€™ll have to change database information in rsstodolist\settings.py file.
